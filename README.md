## Steps
* Ensure the Eclipse IDE has Maven by looking for M2E from Help About ([details](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html))
* Install `DBViewer Plugin 1.2.2.v20101009` by ZIGEN from the Eclipse IDE marketplace
* Import into Eclipse as Git with smart import (accepting all defaults in wizard)
* Let the IDE finish building dependencies before proceeding (see bottom right of Eclipse)
* Run as JUnit test the file `TravelAppTest.java` for sanity testing the local database
